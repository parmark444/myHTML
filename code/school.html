<h2>School</h2>
  <p>I am currently enrolled in the IB Diploma Program, which is to say I am currentl enrolled on h e double hockey sticks on earth. IB Block is the course which gives me the most pain, and I hope that one day in the future kids do not have to go through the same pain me and my fellow peers suffer in these two classes.
  </p>
  <p>IB biology- While this is an IB course, because I took AP Bio last year, I usually tend to slack and not pay attention which really doesn’t matter as I end up doing good on tests and assignments
  </p>
  <p>Spanish 3- This happens to be one of my weak spots, as I tend to not put enough effort into studying. I don’t really enjoy Spanish, but my mom made me take it and I have to stick with for IB Diploma. The teacher is fine, just the class is annoying.

  <p>IB Math HL- This class, really not much to talk about except the fact is I use khan academy and the textbook, otherwise not really a sweat!
  </p>
  <p>IB TOK- an easy A class, we learn a lot about philosophy 
  </p>
  <p>Otherwise, I dont really have much to talk about relating to school, but what I can say is that I am not looking forward to my course work for next year!
