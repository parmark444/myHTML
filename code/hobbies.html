    <p>One of my favorite pastimes is to play video games like any other kid my age. I really enjoy all types of games, but there are some genres that hold a special place in my heart such as Nintendo games. Each time I play a game from Nintendo, I am instantly reminded of better times, and I can find my self spending hours upon hours playing levels in Mario and exploring vast worlds of the Legend of Zelda. Each Nintendo sound track has a special sense of timelessness, and Nintendo will forever go down as my favorite game studio.

    <p>Around the time I started playing video games, I was introduced into the forever expanding world of Star Wars, at around 5-6 years old. Since then, I have continued to be a huge fan of the series, to the point where I can rattle off any fact from the top of my head to 10 minutes of a movie, all the way to lore facts so deep it would take a normal person years to find out about. I love this series to its very core, and will never let it go.

  <h3>Other hobbies of mine</h3>
    <p>Outside of these regular activities, for the past 4 years, I have been heavily associated with the non profit organization FIRST, specifically their First Tech Challenge. Currently I am on team 12611 TechNova, two time Washington State Inspire Award winners and 2018 World Champions. I work primarily on build and 3D design for our team. I am also associated with another FIRST program, First Lego League where I mentor younger kids and push them to further heights. Check us out
