  <h2> A little bit about me...</h2>
    <p>I grew up in Washington for my whole life, mostly in Renton where I attended Apollo Elementary, Briarwood Elementary, Maywood Middle School, Liberty High School, and finally Skyline High School. I have one younger sibling who is in 7th grade right now at Beaver Lake Middle. She is sometimes very annoying but overall we get along. Moving here is very different, as Sammamish is very much like a bubble of affluence. Overall, I like the environment here but I still miss Renton.</p>
